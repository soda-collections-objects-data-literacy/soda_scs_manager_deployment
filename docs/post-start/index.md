# Post-start

This section describes what happens after you run `docker compose up -d` and how to verify that the environment is running correctly.

## After `docker compose up -d`

Once all services are started:

- **Traefik** listens on ports 80 and 443 and routes requests to the appropriate service based on host and labels.
- **MariaDB** (`scs--database`) is already running from `start.sh`; other services (Keycloak, SCS Manager, Nextcloud, JupyterHub, OpenGDB, project website) connect to it as configured.
- **Keycloak** imports the realm from the file generated by pre-install and becomes the identity provider for SCS Manager, Nextcloud, and JupyterHub.
- **Application services** (SCS Manager, Nextcloud, JupyterHub, etc.) start and may run their own health checks or initialization.

## Verifying services

- List running containers:
  ```bash
  docker compose ps
  ```
  Ensure `COMPOSE_FILE` is set (e.g. from `.env`).

- Check logs for a specific service:
  ```bash
  docker compose logs -f <service-name>
  ```
  Examples: `scs--database`, `scs--reverse-proxy`, the Keycloak service name, `scs-manager--drupal`, etc.

- Ensure the database is reachable (already verified by `start.sh`; re-check if needed):
  ```bash
  docker compose exec scs--database mariadb -u root -p"${SCS_DB_ROOT_PASSWORD}" -e "SHOW DATABASES;"
  ```

- Access Keycloak at `https://<KC_DOMAIN>` (e.g. `https://auth.scs.localhost`) and log in with `KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME` and `KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` from `.env`.

- Access other services at their configured domains (e.g. SCS Manager, Nextcloud, JupyterHub) to confirm they respond. Some will require [post-configuration](../post-configuration/index.md) before they work fully (e.g. OpenID client config, Social Login, group scopes).

## Next steps

After confirming that services are up and reachable, follow the [Post-configuration checklist](../post-configuration/checklist.md) to configure Keycloak clients and scopes, SCS Manager settings, Nextcloud Social Login, JupyterHub groups/gids, and other one-time or periodic configuration.
